## Metaheuristic algorithms

Programs created for metaheuristic algorithms classes at university.  
During course following algorithms were implementet:  
* Greedy search
* Tabu search
* Simulated annealing
* Particle swarm  
* Genetic algorithm

Problems that were solved using these programs can be found in `*.pdf` files,  
one in each folder.
